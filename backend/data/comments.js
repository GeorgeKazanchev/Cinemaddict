    'comment': 'This great movie brought out into the open the horrors of heroin addiction. It captured the struggle of a '
    + 'man, Frankie Machine, with a "monkey on his back". Frank Sinatra did his homework, well. The acting is '
    + 'superb, the score is first rate and the actors all gave above average performances. Frank gave one of his '
    + 'best performances. This movie has much to offer.',

    'comment': 'It\'s hard to believe this movie did not get censorship approval. No where in the film do the characters '
    + 'mention what drug was involved or that drugs were even being used. Really the story teaches a morality '
    + 'lesson and that should be applauded.',

    'comment': 'As a whole, this movie doesn\'t work at all. Different parts of the story jump around here and there '
    + 'and fail to form a cohesive piece -- the result of a poorly written script. For instance, halfway into '
    + 'the movie and you still get no idea of where it is all going. You get a vague sense that Johnny\'s '
    + '(Jimmy Stewart) inability to support his family and the consequent strain on his relationship with his '
    + 'wife is part of the main plot, only to be completely thrown off by a new development in the story, which '
    + 'doesn\'t fit into the first portion of the film at all. It\'s almost like watching two different stories '
    + 'at the same time.',

    'comment': 'This film is a monumental piece of film history. I can honestly it might just be one of the best movies of all time. '
    + 'If anything, you have to acknowledge the writing. Almost every single line of dialogue in the film is a household '
    + 'terminology to this day, most people paying tribute to the film without even knowing it. That\'s why I wanted to use '
    + 'a less popular quote for the title, and it has its own meanings within the film. Another joy of the film is composer '
    + 'Max Steiner; yes, Max Steiner of 1933\'s "King Kong". His music is timeless, and he captures the mystery and romance '
    + 'of the film perfectly.',
